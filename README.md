## 🛠️ Deployment Guide (Step-by-Step)

### 📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:
* A **Cloudflare Account** (Free tier is completely fine).
* A **GitHub Account** (Required for Cloudflare Pages integration).

---

### 1. Click the Deploy Button
Click the button below to start the deployment process:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cohive-tms/cohive-cloudflare)

> 💡 **Automatic Updates**  
> Repositories deployed via this button include a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-sync.yml`) that automatically syncs fixes and features from upstream daily, keeping your app **up-to-date automatically without manual action**.  
> 
> **※ Note for Manual Management:**  
> If you prefer to manage updates manually or customize the codebase yourself, please **`Fork`** (or `Use this template`) this repository into your account first. To stop automatic updates, simply delete the `.github/workflows/auto-sync.yml` file (or disable it under the GitHub Actions tab) in your repository.

### 2. Authorize & Deploy on Cloudflare
1. Log in to (or sign up for) your Cloudflare dashboard and authorize GitHub access.
2. Cloudflare will **automatically import** this repository into your own GitHub account.
3. Build configurations and database bindings will be **automatically populated** based on `wrangler.toml`. Simply click "Connect" and "Deploy".

### 3. Visit the URL & Register
Once deployed, Cloudflare will provide a `https://xxx.pages.dev` URL. 
Visiting this URL for the first time will **automatically initialize the D1 database tables**. Fill out the administrator setup form, and you are ready to go!

## 🚀 Production Setup Checklist

When moving your deployment into active production for your team or organization, we strongly recommend following these setup steps to ensure optimal security and operational readiness.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Step1["🚀 STEP 1: One-Click Deploy<br/>(Initial setup & Admin registration)"] --> Step2["🔑 STEP 2: Configure ENCRYPTION_SECRET<br/>(Physical key-data separation against DB leaks)"]
    Step2 --> Step3["✉️ STEP 3: Configure SMTP Email<br/>(Invitations, MFA & Offline notifications)"]
    Step3 --> Step4["🌐 STEP 4: Custom Domain & Access Rules<br/>(CORS restriction, WAF & Zero Trust)"]
```

### 1. 🔑 Strongly Recommended: Set `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` Environment Variable
By default (without environment variables), encryption keys are auto-generated and stored directly inside the D1 database.  
To **completely eliminate the risk of decrypted credentials in the event of a full D1 database leak**, you should store your encryption secret in Cloudflare Workers environment variables (Secrets).

* **Setup Instructions**:
  1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > **Workers & Pages** > Select your deployed project.
  2. Navigate to **Settings > Environment Variables**.
  3. Click **Add variable** and configure:
     - **Variable name**: `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`
     - **Value**: A random 32+ byte secret string (e.g. generated via `openssl rand -hex 32`)
     - **Type**: `Secret (Encrypted)`

> 💡 **Physical Separation Benefit**  
> This physically separates the decryption key from the D1 database storage. Even if your entire D1 database dump is compromised, sensitive values like SMTP passwords **cannot be decrypted**.

---

### 2. ✉️ Recommended: Configure SMTP Email Settings
By default, email sending is **optional**. However, without email settings, you must rely on:
* **Recovery Code** for administrator password recovery (provided during setup).
* **Temporary passwords** issued by the administrator for other workspace members.

To unlock full capabilities (automated workspace invitation emails, offline notifications, and MFA), log in as an administrator, navigate to **Workspace Settings > Email Sending Settings**, and enter your SMTP server credentials (e.g., Google App Password or SMTP credentials from your provider).

## 💡 Under the Hood: What happens in Cloudflare?

When you click deploy, Cloudflare provisions and configures the following resources automatically in your account:

1. **Pages Project**: Hosts the frontend assets and backend serverless API (Functions).
2. **D1 Database (SQL)**: Automatically creates a database named `cohive_db`.
3. **R2 Bucket (Object Storage)**: Automatically creates a storage bucket named `cohive-storage` for attachments/media.
4. **Binding**: Automatically connects the D1 Database and R2 Bucket to your Pages Functions.
5. **Database Initialization**: On your first visit to the deployment URL, the application code automatically executes schema creation (no manual SQL execution needed).

## 🔒 Security Best Practices (Cloudflare Configuration)

For production deployments, we strongly recommend implementing the following security measures in your Cloudflare Dashboard:

### 1. Physical Key Separation (`ENCRYPTION_SECRET`)
Set `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` in Cloudflare Pages Environment Variables as described above to physically separate the encryption key from D1 storage.

### 2. Restrict CORS Origins (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`)
Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your production domain (e.g., `https://chat.yourcompany.com`) to prevent unauthorized cross-origin API requests from third-party websites.

### 3. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Rules
Configure custom WAF rules to protect your application from malicious bots and unauthorized access:
* **Geoblocking**: If your team is located in a specific country, restrict access to that country only.
  - *Rule Expression*: `(ip.geoip.country ne "JP")` -> Action: *Block* (Replace `JP` with your country code).
* **IP Whitelisting**: If you have a static office IP, you can lock down access to your IP only.

### 4. Cloudflare Zero Trust (Access)
Add an extra layer of protection by placing Cloudflare Access in front of your deployment:
* Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > **Zero Trust** > **Access** > **Applications**.
* Create a self-hosted application for your cohive domain.
* Set up a policy requiring identity verification (like Email One-Time Pin or Google Workspace OAuth) before anyone can access the site. This fully protects your application from exposure even if there are unpatched software vulnerabilities.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` | **Recommended for Prod** | 32-byte secret used to encrypt sensitive configuration (e.g., SMTP passwords) using AES-GCM. Setting this physically separates the key from D1 database storage. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Optional | Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins (e.g., `https://cohive.dev,https://app.cohive.dev`). |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Optional | Custom secret key for signing JWT tokens. Auto-generated and stored in D1 database on setup if omitted. |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Optional | Cloudflare R2 Access Key ID (required for generating S3 presigned URLs & direct uploads). |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Optional | Cloudflare R2 Secret Access Key. |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` | Optional | Cloudflare Account ID for R2 endpoints. |
